# B.Duck Sales Report API Integration

> Version: v1  
> Base URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/v1`  
> Endpoint: `GET /reports/sales`  
> Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <INTERNAL_API_KEY>`

## Purpose

Use this API when an external system needs to pull paid-order revenue and sold-item data from B.Duck Ticketing for a selected time range.

The report includes:

- Revenue summary from paid orders
- Sold quantity by product
- Daily revenue rows
- Payment-provider breakdown
- Optional order details for reconciliation

## Authentication

Send the internal API key in the `Authorization` header.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <INTERNAL_API_KEY>
```

Do not expose this key in browser code, mobile apps, or public repositories.

## Request

```http
GET /api/v1/reports/sales?from=2026-06-01&to=2026-06-30
```

### Query Parameters

| Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `to` | Yes | End time. Accepts `YYYY-MM-DD` or ISO-8601 datetime. Date-only values are interpreted as `23:59:59.999` in Vietnam time. |
| `includeOrders` | No | Set to `true` to include order-level rows for reconciliation. Default is `false`. |
| `orderLimit` | No | Max order rows returned when `includeOrders=true`. Min `1`, max `500`, default `100`. |

The maximum allowed range is 366 days.

### Time Zone

The report uses `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` for date-only input and daily grouping. The returned `range.from` and `range.to` values are ISO UTC timestamps.

## Field Notes

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `summary.grossRevenue` | Sum of order `subtotal` before discount. |
| `summary.discountAmount` | Sum of order discount amount. |
| `summary.netRevenue` | Sum of order `finalAmount`. This is the main revenue number. |
| `summary.itemQuantity` | Sum of purchased item quantities from order line items. |
| `summary.passesIssued` | Number of issued pass IDs on paid orders. |
| `productSales.grossRevenue` | Sum of line-item subtotals before order discount allocation. |
| `productSales.netRevenue` | Order final amount allocated proportionally to line items. |
| `dailySales.date` | Local Vietnam date in `YYYY-MM-DD`. |

Only orders with `status = "paid"` are included. The time filter is based on `createdAt` to match the admin dashboard convention.

## Optional Order Rows

When `includeOrders=true`, the response includes:

```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "id": "order_abc123",
      "orderNumber": "BDUCK-20260601-00001",
      "orderCode": "BDK-A3F9X2",
      "status": "paid",
      "customerName": "Nguyen Van A",
      "customerEmail": "a@example.com",
      "customerPhone": "0901234567",
      "paymentProvider": "counter",
      "subtotal": 300000,
      "discountAmount": 0,
      "finalAmount": 300000,
      "itemQuantity": 2,
      "passIds": ["pass_1", "pass_2"],
      "paidAt": "2026-06-01T05:00:00.000Z",
      "createdAt": "2026-06-01T04:50:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "ordersTruncated": false,
  "orderLimit": 100
}
```

If `ordersTruncated=true`, call again with a narrower time range or a higher `orderLimit` up to `500`.

## Error Responses

### Missing or Invalid Date Range

}
```

### Range Too Large

HTTP `400`

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "DATE_RANGE_TOO_LARGE",
  "message": "Date range must be 366 days or less."
}
```

### Unauthorized

HTTP `401`

```json

  "success": false,
  "error": "Unauthorized - invalid or missing API key"

## Recommended Sync Pattern

Pull data by completed business day:

```text
from = yesterday in Vietnam time, YYYY-MM-DD
to   = same date, YYYY-MM-DD
```

For reconciliation, store `generatedAt`, `range`, and the full response payload in the external system. If a retry is needed, repeat the same `from` and `to`; the endpoint is read-only and safe to call multiple times.
